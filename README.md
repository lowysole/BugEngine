# BUG ENGINE

This is an Engine developed for the First Assigment of the Advanced Programming Master by UPC Tech School.
It's a work in progress. For now, it has the feature of loading a Model with a .fbx format and being able to change the texture of this Model. A camera is set up, and it allows you to move arround the Engine world and the model, having differents options to modify the basic parametes. 
Here you can find the link to the project:

## How to use

 - Unlock
  	 - `unlock <room> with <item>` -- Unlock the door with the item
 - Help
	 - `help` - List the commands
 - Quit
	 - `quit` - Quit the game
	 

## Further developments
Some ideas to improve the Engine are:
  - Add the View to a new UI window
  - Make UI windows adaptable to the change of the aspect ratio dynamically
  - Optimize the loading textures logic
